title: Welcome to Phase 4!
tags: phase-4 agile
---

The past twelve weeks have prepared you to take on the challenge ahead in these next four weeks. Your goal is to design and build a real-world software product, working collaboratively on a small team using agile development practices and all the tools you've already learned -- and some you will learn as you go.

At the end of the phase, your team will present your product to an audience of local tech professionals, hiring partners, and your peers.

The experience of working on a team during this phase and the product you build will form the foundation for your job search after graduation.

**You will not begin writing code for your project until Thursday of this week.**

## Today's topics

- What is agile development?
- Forming final project groups
- Brainstorming product ideas

## Final Project Teams

Talk with your team about project ideas. Come prepared tomorrow with one really good idea, or more than one idea if you can't decide. We will discuss and refine together tomorrow.
