Today we looked at how to add models with relationships to the API and set up permissions so users cannot edit models they should not be able to.

## Assignments

Finish adding an API to Habit Tracker. By Monday, you should be able to complete all tasks through the API:

- list habits
- create a new habit
- view a habit
- update a habit
- delete a habit
- list records for a habit on the habit detail API endpoint
- create a record for a habit
- update a record for a habit
- delete a record from a habit

Your application should be deployed to Heroku.

### Stretch goals

- adding a record to a habit by date
- updating a record to a habit by date (may be the same endpoint as adding a record)
- deleting a record from a habit by date
