For the rest of this phase, you will work on a project with 2 other teammates. This project is a joint front-end/back-end project, with the front-end developed in React and the back-end developed with Django and Django REST Framework. For some of you, you can work on both of these, so I'll let you self-organize into who builds what.

The project: [Social ECards](https://classroom.github.com/g/Pgs4JmQ5). This is a group project, so one person should click the link and create the team, and then other team members click and join.

The teams:

- Logan, Tracy, Matt
- David, Dan, Jesse

One suggestion is that you choose a team leader to guide your group. This person shouldn't be "in charge," but maybe is the person to make final decisions if you're torn between different approaches to a problem. This can help speed you up.

We'll talk about this project in class today. Remember to **read the README very carefully**.
