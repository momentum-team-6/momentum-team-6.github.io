### ⭐️ EXTRA/TMI

Another option for CSS layout is called "grid", also built into CSS. With flexbox you choose to line up your boxes either vertically or horizontally, but with grid you can specify both horizontal and vertical arrangement in the same box.

Before we had flexbox or grid built into CSS, we relied on floats for layout. You should not be using floats to lay out your pages, but you may still see them in other people's code. Because of that, you may want to familiarize yourself at some point.
