Today we're going to spend most of our time working through whatever issues you have having with your project, but we will also spend time talking about automated testing.

## Project

By tomorrow, you should have your social ecards project ready to demo. You will have features left to improve and bugs to work out, but there should be no more decisions to make.

## Resources

- [Django docs on testing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/testing/)
