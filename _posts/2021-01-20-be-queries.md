- [Lookup expressions with `.filter()`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/#field-lookups)
- [Lookups that span relationships](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/#lookups-that-span-relationships)
- [Complex lookups with Q](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/#complex-lookups-with-q-objects)
- [Related objects](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/#related-objects)

For your assignment, you should work on Habit Tracker as much as possible. By tomorrow, you should have their models complete, as well as views for creating, updating, and deleting habits.
