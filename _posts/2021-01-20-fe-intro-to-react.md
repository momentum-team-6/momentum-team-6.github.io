Today, we'll start on our journey into React.

## Assignment

[Complete this tutorial for React](https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-react-2020/). This will show you the most modern way to build React apps. This project will be in Git, but you will use a repository you make.

If you finish this and would like a second exercise, I recommend one of these other tutorials:

- [The Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) - video-driven, very complete
- [The official React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) - classic, official. Uses class-based components, which are a bit older, but still widely used
- [Dave Ceddia's React tutorial](https://daveceddia.com/react-getting-started-tutorial/) - very long, very comprehensive

## Resources

- [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
