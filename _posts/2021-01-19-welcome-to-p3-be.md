Today, we're focusing on deploying Django applications to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). For the rest of the week, we'll be focused on digging deeper into Django, particularly models.

## Assignment

You'll be working on [Habit Tracker](https://classroom.github.com/a/Hwukd7uD) this week. For tonight, you should generate the project skeleton, get it deployed to Heroku, and design your models.
